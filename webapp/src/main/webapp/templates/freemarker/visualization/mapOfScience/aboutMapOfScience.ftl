<h2>About VIVO's Map of Science Visualization</h2>
<h3>Reference Basemap</h3>
<p>The VIVO Map of Science visualization uses the UCSD map of science and classification
system that was computed using paper-level data from about 25,000 journals from Elsevier's
Scopus and Clarivate Analytics' Web of Science (WoS) for the years 2001-2010. The UCSD map
of science assigns the 25,000 journals to 554 subdisciplines that are further aggregated
into 13 main disciplines of science. In the map, each discipline has a distinct color
(green for 'Biology', brown for 'Earth Sciences', etc.) and a label. (Sub)disciplines that
are similar closer to one another on the map. (Sub)disciplines that are especially similar
are connected by grey lines.</p>

<h3>Data Overlay</h3>
<p>Publication activity of a university, organization, or person can be overlaid on the
map to generate expertise profiles. The process is as follows: (1) The set of unique
journals is identified, (2) the number of times each journal served as a publication venue
is calculated, and (3) the area size of the 13 disciplines and 554 subdisciplines is
calculated based on these journal publication venue counts. Note that some journals are
associated with exactly one (sub)discipline while others, e.g., interdisciplinary ones like
<em>Science</em> or <em>Nature</em>, are fractionally associated with multiple
(sub)disciplines. Subdisciplines inherit the colors of their parent disciplines.
(Sub)disciplines without any associated publications are given in gray.</p>

<h3>Expertise Profile Comparison Map</h3>
<p>Publication activity of up to three organizations or persons can be compared via "Compare
organizations." In the table on the left, select up to three organizations. The expertise
profile of each organizations will be represented as data overlay. Each organizations is
represented in a distinct color and a top-10 list of subdisciplines with the highest number
of publications is given below the comparison map. Data can be saved as CSV file.</p>

<h3>Interactivity</h3>
<p>The map can be explored at two levels-by 13 disciplines or 554 subdisciplines. Clicking
on a node in the map brings up the number of fractionally associated journal publications
and the percentage of publications mapped to this (sub)discipline. Hover over a discipline
in the table on the left to see what circles it corresponds to on the map. Use slider below
map, on the right to reduce number of subdisciplines shown to improve legibility</p>

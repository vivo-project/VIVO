grants_text_one = This body is from the the template file \
                vivo/productMods/templates/freemarker/body/menupage/grants.ftl.  \
                In the display model, the grants page has a display:requiresBodyTemplate \
                property that defines that the grants page overrides the default template. \
                The default template for these pages is at /vitro/webapp/web/templates/freemarker/body/menupage/menupage.ftl
grants_two = This technique could be used to define pages without menu items, that get \
                their content from a freemarker template.  An example would be the about page.
grants_text_three = This would create a page that would use about.ftl as the body.  The page would be \
                accessed via /about and would override all servlet mappings in web.xml.

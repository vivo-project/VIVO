why_needed = Why is it needed?
vis_tools_note_one = Large-scale visualizations like the Temporal Graph or the Map of Science involve calculating total counts of publications or of grants for some entity. Since this also means checking through all of its sub-entities, the underlying queries can be both memory-intensive and time-consuming. For a faster user experience, we wish to save the results of these queries for later re-use.
vis_caching_process = What's involved in the caching process?
vis_tools_note_two = To this end we have devised a caching solution which will retain information about the hierarchy of organizations -- namely, which publications are attributed to which organizations -- by storing the RDF model.
vis_tools_note_three = We're currently caching these models in memory.  The cache is built (only once) on the first user request after a server restart.  Because of this, the same model will be served until the next restart. This means that the data in these models may become stale depending upon when it was last created. This works well enough for now. In future releases we will improve this solution so that models are stored on disk and periodically updated.
vis_tools_note_four = The models are refreshed each time the server restarts.  Since this is not generally practical on production instances, administrators can instead use the "refresh cache" link above to do this without a restart.

cap_map_text_headline2=Interacting with the visualisation
cap_map_text3=By clicking on any node in the visualisation, additional information can be viewed in the 'Info' tab on the right-hand side. For groups of people, the participants in the group and their information can be viewed, and individual researchers can be removed from the graph. Selecting a search term will display all attached groups. Under each group full information for each person is retrieved, and the number of matching grants and publications for each researcher within the mapped capabilities is shown. Clicking on a researcher's name will lead to the original search results.
cap_map_text_headline3=Visual cues
cap_map_text4=To make the visualisation easier to read, search terms and groups are scaled according to the number of results returned. Groups are also given different shades according to the number of connected search terms. The darker the shade, the more search terms a group is connected to.

cap_map_text_headline5=Changing the cutoff value
cap_map_text5=The amount of researchers retrieved for each search term for is limited by the cutoff value in the search form (10 by default). Increasing this cutoff will increase the likelihood of an intersection between different search terms. This will also increase the complexity of the graph, however, and may make it difficult to identify patterns.

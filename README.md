# VIVO: Connect, Share, Discover

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/vivo-project/VIVO.png?branch=develop)](https://travis-ci.org/vivo-project/VIVO)

VIVO is an open source semantic web tool for research discovery -- finding people and the research they do.

VIVO supports editing, searching, browsing and visualizing research activity in order to discover people, programs, 
facilities, funding, scholarly works and events. VIVO's search returns results faceted by type for rapid retrieval of 
desired information across disciplines.

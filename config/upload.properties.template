# The UploadImagesServlet will upload the images to a directory
# that is under tomcat and serve them from there.
# This causes a problem when the tomcat/webapps dir is deleted
# or deployed because you will lose all the images that the
# curators have uploaded. We deal with this by copying
# the files to another directory, one that is under version control.

# This property indicates which non-tomcat directory to save the images in.
# ${uploadDir} is defined in the main build.xml via the following statements:
#
# <!-- defined in globalbuild.properties -->
# <property name="source.dir" value="{source.home}"/>
# <property name="uploadDir" value="{source.dir}/webapp/web" />
#
# But, this value will be replaced by the Vitro/clones/build.xml
# to point to the clones/{clone}/modifications directory based on the following
# <property file="./config/globalbuild.properties"/>
# <property name="source.dir" value="{source.home}"/>
# <property name="uploadDir" value="${source.dir}/clones/${clone}/modifications"/>
#
# The UploadImagesServlet.getSourceDirName() method then looks at this parameter
# in the upload.properties file, which file is stuck by the clones/build.xml file
# into the clone's modifications/WEB-INF/classes directory:
UploadImagesServlet.sourceDirName=${deploy.upload.directory}
